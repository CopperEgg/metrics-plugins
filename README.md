metrics-plugins
===========================

Example scripts, tools, etc for RevealMetrics.

This repository contains contributed scripts, examples, and other tools to help get the most out of CopperEgg's custom metrics API and service.

Note:

You can add widgets to CopperEgg which display data from any metric groups, including system metrics gathered using CopperEgg's other services.

Have a look at the [CopperEgg Demo site](https://app.copperegg.com/demo), to see more ideas on how to customize and optimize your cloud infrastructure and application monitoring.

Don't forget that you can set alerts and notifications based on the custom metrics being gathered, just as simply as setting up all of your CopperEgg system and website monitoring alerts. Simply go to the Issues tab, and navigate to Configure Alerts.

===========================

Example scripts, tools, etc for RevealMetrics.

This repository contains contributed scripts, examples, and other tools to help get the most out of Uptime Cloud Monitor's custom metrics API and service.

Note:

You can add widgets to Uptime Cloud Monitor which display data from any metric groups, including system metrics gathered using Uptime Cloud Monitor's other services.

Have a look at the [Uptime Cloud Monitor Demo site](https://app.copperegg.com/demo), to see more ideas on how to customize and optimize your cloud infrastructure and application monitoring.

Don't forget that you can set alerts and notifications based on the custom metrics being gathered, just as simply as setting up all of your Uptime Cloud Monitor system and website monitoring alerts. Simply go to the Issues tab, and navigate to Configure Alerts.
